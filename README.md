optimal_file_sync
=================

Optimal File Sync is a file synchronization utility that syncs files(like photos) from a folder on the phone to a folder on a Samba/Windows server. 
It doesn't synchronize until it detects that it is on the same network. 

Written in pure Python/Py4A/Kivy, it is meant as a show case app for the Kivy framework:

Features:

* Only syncs when WIFI is available
* Only syncs when on the same network as the target server
* Runs as a background service
* Syncs when new files have been created
* Disregards temporary video files
* Open source
* Low system load
* Written in pure Python/Py4A/Kivy, meant as a show case app for the Kivy framework
* Currently only Android, but an IOS package is in the works.
